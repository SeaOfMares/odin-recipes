                Roast the 4-pound prime rib (see footnote if
                using a larger and smaller roast) in the
                preheated oven for 20 minutes. Turn the oven
                off and,leaving the roast in the oven with the
                door closed,let the roast sit in the oven for 2
                hours. Remove roast from the oven,slice,and serve.

    <h3>Cook's Note:</h3>
    <p>
        Your cooking times will vary depending on
        the size of your prime rib roast.To calculate
        your cooking time,multiply the exact weight of
        the roast by 5. Round the resulting number to
        the nearest whole number. The rib is cooked at
        500 degrees F for exactly that many minutes.
        For example, for a 6 pound roast: 6x5 = 30, so
        cooking time is 30 minutes. Turn the oven off
        and wait 2 hours before opening the oven door.
        Remove the prime rib and slice into the most 
        perfectly medium-rare meat you've ever seen.
